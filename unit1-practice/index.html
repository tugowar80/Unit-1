    <p>Hello there! My name is Brian and am super happy I made the decision to take this bootcamp. I have decades of IT experience, just bought a house, and am a cat dad.

    <h2><h2 id="my-start">How I got my start
    </h2>
    <p>I've been in the technology field for decades so I've always worked alongside the coders. They always seemed to love what they did and as soon as another postion opened up, it was almost immediately filled. I'd love to have a job I love and I think this may be it.</p>
    <p>I ended up choosing the Grand Circus bootcamp because I had a couple different co-workers who went through them and they couldn't stop hyping it. I took the pre-bootcamp a few months ago and finally got the itch to take on this.</p>
